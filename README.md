# NERD-Stack

This project contains Node, Express, React, and DynamoDB.

In order to run DynamoDB locally: 

Download docker amazon/dynamodb-local container [https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/dynamodb-local/]

I also recommend using NoSQL Workbench [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/workbench.settingup.html]
